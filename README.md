# singularity
A JCU repository for singularity container builds.

This repository, created by JCU HPC staff, should contain a script and
"metadata" files for creation of singularity container(s) with an
embedded conda environment.  This repository was used to create >100
singularity containers for JCU.

This respository also house singularity definition files for creation
of containers which do not house a conda environment.

Development of this repository is primarily for internal JCU use.  If
it works for you, we would appeciate hearing reports of "container
works".  If it doesn't work for you, we cannot provide any guarantee
on response time to constructive feedback.

Use of Singularity HPC may be a better choice for others.
